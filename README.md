## An Intro to Our Project
The goal of our web app is to forecast acid rain and photochemical smog, atmospheric events which negatively impact the health of humans and the environment. With the causes of said events being largely attributed to human activities, the app also aims to be an educational tool, creating awareness by making lifestyle suggestions catered to the air quality of the location the user inputs. We wanted our app to not be just a dashboard displaying numbers grabbed from an API, but rather an inferring tool capable of making abstractions out of data. 

## How to use it
The user can input a location in latitude and longitude. The interface will then display the risk at that current location for two different atmospheric events: acid rain and photochemical smog. There are three levels of risk: low, medium, and high. Sorting these levels of risk makes it easier for the user to understand what the data is telling them. When they enter in the location, suggestions will also appear below on how they can tackle the issue with long-term and short-term solutions. The location is also stored so that the next time the user opens up the product, their previously entered location is there.

## How we came up with our idea
We originally wanted to make some kind of product that could help the environment. We started by combing through air quality/ pollution APIs to get a sense of the data available for us to work with.
